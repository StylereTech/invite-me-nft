# Invite Me — Consumer Journey (from Jefe/Partner, Feb 16 2026)

## The Vision: Full AI-Powered Event Planning Platform
_Way beyond NFT invitations — this is end-to-end event management._

---

## 1. Onboarding & Discovery
- AI mascot greets user (e.g., "Sparky the Genie")
- "What kind of event?" → Birthday, Anniversary, Social Gathering, Baby Shower, etc.
- "What's the vibe?" → Free-form text or mood icons (🎉✨🕺)
- AI cross-references trends and past successful events

## 2. AI-Generated Event Blueprint
- **Theme Suggestion**: Mood board, color palettes, decor ideas, DALL·E-generated photos
- **Budget Breakdown**: Venue, Catering, Entertainment, Decor — real-time tracking
- **Checklist & Timeline**: 4-week countdown with milestones
- User can edit anything, ask AI for alternatives

## 3. Vendor Discovery & Booking (Marketplace)
- AI-curated vendor recommendations (distance, price, rating, availability)
- Vendor profiles: photos, reviews, certification badges ("Academy Graduate")
- Booking: select → available dates → deposit via Stripe → commission taken
- Automated confirmation emails + calendar invites

## 4. Collaborative Event Hub (Shared Page)
- RSVP tracking with meal preferences
- Gift registry / "contribute to party fund"
- Photo sharing post-event
- Group chat for planning
